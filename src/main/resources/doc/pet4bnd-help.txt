Syntax:
HELP | OPTIONS

Using a HELP option causes printing this help and the program terminates with 
the SUCCESS exit code. The HELP options are case insensitive and any of these
may appear: help, -help, --help, -h, -?, /h, /?

Using any of the other OPTIONS performs the actions according to the OPTIONS. At
least one argument is always required. Following OPTIONS may appear:

-bundle-version     Print the target bundle version to STDOUT
-debug              Print debugging information on an error
-pet FILE           Use the specified source FILE ('./exports.pet' is default)
-bnd FILE           Render the specified .bnd FILE
-properties FILE    Render the specified .properties FILE
-restore            Restore the baseline versions in the source file
-verbose            Print all details

The -properties option renders either classical Java properties file, or if the
FILE argument has the '.xml' extension, an XML properties file is created then.

All output, except for the result of the -bundle-version option, is printed to
STDERR; therefore STDOUT always provides just the target bundle version, which
usually is the most important output of this tool for scripting purposes.

All the OPTIONS listed above may be used together. If an option appears more
than once, the latest occurrence of the option prevails.
